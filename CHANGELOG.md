# Changelog

## [0.8.1]

### 🐛 Fixes

- Reverted features from 0.8.0 release due to breaking errors. I will polish this up in the future for a rerelease.

## [0.8.0] 

### ✨ Features

- Toggl reports are now cached for the duration of an Obsidian user session, meaning that reports are only fetched once. Subsequent reports over the same time spans should now load nearly instantly!

## [0.7.3]

### ⚙️ Internal

- When installed on API version 0.13.25 or higher, the plugin now uses Obsidian's own `requestUrl` API instead of the third-party dependency `got`. This lays the foundation for supporting Mobile platforms in the future.

## [0.7.2]

### 🐛 Fixes

- Fix timers having "Unknown project" on opening Obsidian (issue #32)
- Fixed the start/stop button accent color to be more accessible on Minimal Theme (issue #67)

## [0.7.1] 

### ✨ Features

- When hovering over the project color circle of a list report row, it shows a tooltip with the project name.

### 🐛 Fixes

- Fixed extra vertical whitespace appearing when a report block is rendered in preview mode.
- Filtering by tags is now properly case insensitive.

## [0.7.0]

### ✨ Features

- Entries in a list report now show applied tags. Entries will only stack if their tags are the same. (issue #44)
- Added support for filtering reports by tags via `{INCLUDE|EXCLUDE} TAGS #tag1[, #tag2, ...]` (issue #55)

See the [documentation](https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-toggl-integration/wiki/Toggl-Query-Language-(TQL)-Reference#filtering-tags) on how to use tag filters.

### ⚙️ Internal

- Summary reports now only request a detailed report from the Toggl API instead of a summary report and a detailed report, resulting in faster load times for small reports.

## [0.6.1]

### 🐛 Fixes

- Entries in a list report group are now ordered by entry start time (issue #55)
- `SORT DESC` now sorts entries inside list report groups in order of descending starting time (issue #55)

## [0.6.0]

### ✨ Features

- The daily total time in the sidebar will update in real time when a time entry is active. (If you find this distracting, it can be disabled in the settings.) (issue #28)
- Hovering over the sidebar bar chart will now show the project name and total duration in a tooltip.

### 🐛 Fixes

- Fixed summary report pie chart showing a black segment for time entries with no assigned project. (issue #53)
 
## [0.5.1] 

### ✨ Features

- Time entries with a Markdown link as description (e.g. automatically started from Todoist tasks) will now only display the link annotation in list reports. (issue #43)


### 🐛 Fixes

- Fix time entries with very long descriptions overflowing the rendered list report block (issue #43)
- Fix explicity `GROUP BY DATE` expression causing exceptions. (issue #45)
- Add better error handling while rendering reports (issue #45)

## [0.5.0]

### ✨ Features

- Added support for filtering reports by client via `{INCLUDE|EXCLUDE} CLIENTS "Client A"[, "Client B", ...]`
- Added support for grouping list reports by client via `GROUP BY CLIENT`

## [0.4.1] 

### 🐛 Fixes

- Fixed time entries without a project showing project 'null' in Toggl reports (now listed under '(No project)').
- Fixed duplicated time entries from the Toggl API response inflating total times in reports.
- Fixed summary report bar chart tooltips from saying "week" instead of the month's name.

## [0.4.0]

This is the biggest update so far! This update enables you to visualize your Toggl time entry data right inside your Obsidian notes.

To learn how, check out the [getting started](https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-toggl-integration/wiki/Creating-Toggl-reports-inside-notes) page!

### ✨ Features

- You can now generate Toggl reports inside notes using code blocks with the language '`toggl`'
- Generate summary reports
- Generate list reports

### 🐛 Fixes

- (Probably) fixed [a bug](https://github.com/mcndt/obsidian-toggl-integration/issues/34) where the sidebar periodically clears due to failing API requests.

## [0.3.0]

### ✨ Features

- Sidebar view now shows tags on active time entry.
- You can now add tags to a new time entry when entering the description.
- Adding tags to a time entry uses autocompletion using the Toggl workspace's existing tags.

### ⚙️ Internal

- Plugin now immediately refreshes current timer status when starting/stopping a time entry and on plugin load.

## [0.2.5]

### HOTFIX

- Reduced the active timer polling rate to once every 6 seconds by request by from the Toggl Track API team.

## [0.2.4]

### HOTFIX

Toggl started responding with error status 418 on all requests with the default user-agent of the npm got package, so I set a custom user agent to identify calls made by this plugin.

Hopefully this won't happen again!

## [0.2.3]

### 🐛 Fixes

- Fix tags not being added on repeat time entries when starting a new time entry (thanks @AetheresMMI for the bug report!).

## [0.2.2]

### 🐛 Fixes

- Fix stop timer command actually opening the start timer modal (thanks @ljantzen for the bug report!)

## [0.2.1]

### 🐛 Fixes

- Fix summary sidebar panel showing `undefined` when running a time entry with no description.
- Fix project summary list not updating after stopping a timer

## [0.2.0]

Hello! This release features a basic implementation of the Toggl Track summary view for the sidebar.
Currently, this view can show you an overview of your day (total time + breakdown per project),
but in the future I will add more functionality to it (e.g. choose between day or week summary). 
Additonally, you can see your current time entry here as well as a button to start or stop time entries.

If you have any suggestions on how this sidebar panel can be improved for your workflow, please post in the Discussions tab on GitHub or tag me on the Obsidian Discord server! 

### ✨ Features

- Add summary of current time entry in side panel
- Add functionality to start or stop timers from the side panel (button triggers the respective commands)
- Add summary view of current day in side panel

### ⚙️ Internal

- Upgraded [toggl-client](https://github.com/saintedlama/toggl-client) dependency to commit `4a40a9d` of master branch to add the Toggl Reports API.
